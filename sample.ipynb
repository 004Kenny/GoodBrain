    "A conversational Python bot to guide users through a mental wellness check-in, recommend coping strategies, and provide supportive resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features:\n",
    "- Friendly conversational flow with text-to-speech (British accent) for accessibility and warmth.\n",
    "- Reflective listening and summarization.\n",
    "- Crisis detection with immediate resource guidance.\n",
    "- Personalized strategy recommendations based on user check-in.\n",

    "# - platform: lets us find out which operating system we're on (Windows, Mac, Linux).\n",
    "# - subprocess and shutil: help us run other programs on the computer, like speaking text aloud.\n",
    "# - re: helps us find and remove certain parts of text (like hints in parentheses).\n",
